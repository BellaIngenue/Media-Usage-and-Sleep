# Media Usage and Sleep Quality

Based off an Undergrad Project I took in Community College in late 2019 in my Psychology course, PSYC 255: Introduction to Psychological Research where we studied the association between Media Usage (specifically TV) and its effects on Sleep Quality.

## Documentation

### Overview of the Past Research Project and Prior Hypothesis:
**Research Question**: This research study explored the association between watching media, specifically television, and its effects on sleep quality. Using a custom survey, our team collected data from a sample of students (n=21) from our Psychology class. 

**Hypothesis**: *We predicted that increased media and television usage would contribute to a lower quality of sleep.*

### Current Hypothesis and Updated Information:
**Research Question**: This new updated Data Project is still exploring the same association between Media Usage and Sleep Quality. The only difference is the mathematical data and the analysis sections. The datasets I will be using are the same ones given from that course. 

**Hypothesis**: *In similaritiy to the previous work, I predicted that increased media and television usage would contribute to a lower quality of sleep.*

### Ethics and Privacy

**Do I have permisssion to use this data?** As all of the data I have is from an open-ended survey I had conducted in Undergrad, I do not see a problem with using it for this project.

**Are there potential biases in your dataset(s), in terms of who it composes, and how it was collected, that may be problematic in terms of it allowing for equitable analysis?** All of the data collected was in a very small class and in the form of a survey. Everyone in my class took the survey so we had about n=21 students participate. There was no randomization or any other form of selection techniques. There is a high chance that this data is no longer useful, as it was also prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic. 

**What will you be doing with this data?** I do not intend to ever use this project for monetary use, this is strictly for educational purposes only.
